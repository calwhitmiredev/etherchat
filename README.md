# etherchat
A social media network based around the ethereum block-chain built off of solidity, java-script, and HTML. <br />

It works by calling events to the ethereum blockchain, then by looking back throughout the blockchain to find the logs of the events. <br />

Features:  <br />
  - Currently etherchat contains two events in the EthProj.sol contract. <br />
    - Event 1: Message: <br />
      - The message event contains three variables: <br />
        - 1: Message text <br />
        - 2: Sender <br />
        - 3: Amount of gas <br />
      - The Message event is not fully implimented in the interface: still WIP. <br />
    - Event 2: Username <br />
      - The username event contains three variables: <br />
        - 1: Username <br />
        - 2: Sender <br />
        - 3: Amount of gas <br />
       - The Username event is not fully implimented in the interface: still WIP. <br />
